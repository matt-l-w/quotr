----------------------------------------

This little app is born from a frustration of ruining my own books with hundreds of dog-ears just to mark interesting snippets.

It's a work in progress right now.

## Getting Started 
This is a standard Django app and all the common practices that go with that are recognisable here.

[Read more about Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/) to get started.

## Environment Variables
In order to run the application, some environment variables need to be defined.

```bash
echo "ENV=DEV\nSECRET_KEY=<some_long_string>" > .env
```

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Heroku.
